## Algorithmic Level (Digital Design Architect)
- Focuses on functions with an arbitrary number of clock cycles.
- Utilizes algorithms and mathematical equations.
- Can leverage the full capabilities of the SystemVerilog language.

## Register Transfer Level (RTL) (Digital Design Engineers)
- Emphasizes functions with specific clock cycle timing.
- Includes combinational and sequential logic.
- Must adhere to strict language constraints to ensure synthesizability.

## Gate Level (Standard Cell Library Design Engineer)
- Incorporates both function and structure.
- Utilizes macro cells and logic primitives.

## Switch Level (Physical Design Engineers for place and route)
- Closest to the physical silicon implementation.
